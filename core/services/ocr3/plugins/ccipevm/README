This package contains EVM specific CCIP dependencies. It is placed outside `ccipocr3` module in order to keep
it clean and not to have any EVM specific dependencies.

This implementations should be moved after provider designs are finalized.
Currently there is a limitation, if a node does not support the destination chain,
it doesn't have a relayer instance and also not a provider instance that gives access to this dependencies.
