This package contains EVM specific CCIP dependencies. It should be placed outside `ccipocr3` module in order to keep
it clean and not to have any EVM specific dependencies before merging this PR.

This implementations should be moved after provider designs are finalized.
Currently there is a limitation, if a node does not support the destination chain,
it doesn't have a relayer instance and also not a provider instance that gives access to this dependencies.
