/// @notice This is a multi-sig contract that supports signing many transactions (called "ops" in
/// the context of this contract to prevent confusion with transactions on the underlying chain)
/// targeting many chains with a single set of signatures. Authorized ops along with some metadata
/// are stored in a Merkle tree, which is generated offchain. Each op has an associated chain id,
/// ManyChainMultiSig contract address and nonce. The nonce enables us to enforce the
/// (per-ManyChainMultiSig contract instance) ordering of ops.
///
/// At any time, this contract stores at most one Merkle root. In the typical case, all ops
/// in the Merkle tree are expected to be executed before another root is set. Since the Merkle root
/// itself reveals ~ no information about the tree's contents, we take two measures to improve
/// transparency. First, we attach an expiration time to each Merkle root after which it cannot
/// be used any more. Second, we embed metadata in the tree itself that has to be proven/revealed
/// to the contract when a new root is set; the metadata contains the range of nonces (and thus
/// number of ops) in the tree intended for the ManyChainMultiSig contract instance on which the
/// root is being set.
///
/// Once a root is registered, *anyone* is allowed to furnish proofs of op inclusion in the Merkle
/// tree and execute the corresponding op. The contract enforces that ops are executed in the
/// correct order and with the correct arguments. A notable exception to this is the gas limit of
/// the call, which can be freely determined by the executor. We expect (transitive) callees to
/// implement standard behavior of simply reverting if insufficient gas is provided. In particular,
/// this means callees should not have non-reverting gas-dependent branches.
///
/// Note: In the typical case, we expect the time from a root being set to all of the ops
/// therein having been executed to be on the order of a couple of minutes.
