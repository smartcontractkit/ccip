/**
 * @notice Contract module which acts as a timelocked controller with role-based
 * access control. When set as the owner of an `Ownable` smart contract, it
 * can enforce a timelock on `onlyOwner` maintenance operations and prevent
 * a list of blocked functions from being called. The timelock can be bypassed
 * by a bypasser or an admin in emergency situations that require quick action.
 *
 * Non-emergency actions are expected to follow the timelock.
 *
 * The contract has five roles. Each role can be inhabited by multiple
 * (potentially overlapping) addresses.
 *
 * 1) Admin: The admin manages membership for all roles (including the admin
 *    role itself). The admin automatically inhabits all other roles. The admin
 *    can call the bypasserExecuteBatch function to bypass any restrictions like
 *    the delay imposed by the timelock and the list of blocked functions. The
 *    admin can manage the list of blocked functions. In practice, the admin
 *    role is expected to (1) be inhabited by a contract requiring a secure
 *    quorum of votes before taking any action and (2) to be used rarely, namely
 *    only for emergency actions or configuration of the RBACTimelock.
 *
 * 2) Proposer: The proposer can schedule delayed operations that don't use any
 *    blocked function selector.
 *
 * 3) Executor: The executor can execute previously scheduled operations once
 *    their delay has expired. The contract enforces that the calls in an
 *    operation are executed with the correct args (target, data, value), but
 *    the executor can freely choose the gas limit. Since the executor is
 *    typically not particularly trusted, we recommend that (transitive) callees
 *    implement standard behavior of simply reverting if insufficient gas is
 *    provided. In particular, this means callees should not have non-reverting
 *    gas-dependent branches.
 *
 * 4) Canceller: The canceller can cancel operations that have been scheduled
 *    but not yet executed.
 *
 * 5) Bypasser: The bypasser can bypass any restrictions like the delay imposed
 *    by the timelock and the list of blocked functions to immediately execute
 *    operations, e.g. in case of emergencies.
 *
 * Note that this contract doesn't place any restrictions on the gas limit used
 * when executing operations. See the above comment on the executor role for
 * more details.
 *
