### Usage

```

### Changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning the contracts.

Every PR that modifies any configuration or code, should most likely accompanied by a changeset file.

To install `changesets`:
  1. Install `pnpm` if it is not already installed - [docs](https://pnpm.io/installation).
  2. Run `pnpm install`.

Either after or before you create a commit, run the `pnpm changeset` command in the `contracts` directory to create an accompanying changeset entry which will reflect on the CHANGELOG for the next release.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
